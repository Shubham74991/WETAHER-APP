# Weather Now

Welcome to the Weather Now App! This web application allows you to check the current weather conditions for different locations around the world.

## Features

1. **Geolocation Permission**: The app asks for geolocation permission when loaded. If granted, it shows the weather for your current location. If denied, it displays default weather data for Mumbai.

2. **Unit Selection**: You can choose the unit (e.g., Celsius, Fahrenheit) for displaying temperature using a select input.

3. **City Search**: Enter a city name in the search input to check the weather for that specific location.

4. **Find Current Location**: Click the "Find My Location" button to fetch weather data for your current location (requires geolocation permission).
